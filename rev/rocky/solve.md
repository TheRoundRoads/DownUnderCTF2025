This challenge is a simple hash checker.
The hash `70924d0cf669f9d23ccabd561202351f` is loaded in memory. The program then takes our input and passes it through an MD5 hash function to check if the input matches.

Putting this hash in `crackstation.net`, we get the password: `emergencycall911`.

Using that with the executable, we can get the flag `DUCTF{In_the_land_of_cubicles_lined_in_gray_Where_the_clock_ticks_loud_by_the_light_of_day}`
